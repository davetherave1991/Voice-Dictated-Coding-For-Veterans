# Voice-Dictated-Coding-For-Veterans
This is a project intended to assist veterans to learn and write computed code with voice controlled commands.

The intention of this project is to assist amputated veterans write code by voice. 
Currently the project exist as a extension of the Vocola coding language created by Rick Mohr. 
My current version operates with the use of Natlink (created by Joel Gould) and Dragon NaturallySpeaking (a Nuance product)  to write out the commands. 
My long term goals for the project is to create a hardware device (similar to Alexa) that would allow for the automation of a desktop environment and the writing and editing of multiple (if not all) coding languages as well as the development of a standardized spoken coding language to be used to both teach and enable individuals to create coding projects with the use of one's own voice.
Currently I have written an abundance of Python commands for reference scripting as well as I have begun to develop the basics in other languages and am now realizing that my idea is growing in scale and this is something I will not be able to complete alone. 
I look forward to seeing where this project will lead."
